            Congratulations, you’ve made it to the back of the magazine! I
            really hope you enjoyed it. These little messages from Print
            Managing Editors usually go at the front, you know, as a little
            primer, but things change — and instead you’re getting a sort of
            post-game, behind-the-scenes look into the making of all of those
            stories you read. Variety is the spice of both life and magazine
            formatting.
          </p>
          <p>
            A former PME once wrote that student journalism is a labor of love,
            and I believe that now more than ever. This magazine came to be not
            only over the course of our third quarter online, but also Winter
            Quarter online. Winters are already a tough time, with frigid
            Evanston temperatures and the occasional 28 inches of snow, but this
            amazing staff of editors, designers, writers and fact-checkers not
            only survived but thrived, producing something really special in the
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had stories that found the light, even amidst the winter blues.
            You read about students’ fond Burger King memories and the way
            they’re decorating the dorm rooms they occupy most of the time;
            adventures with what might be the grossest alcoholic beverage known
            to man; and poking fun at the potential beer pong ban (please don’t
            do it). You learned how students have found communities, albeit
            virtual, through student clubs and their own small businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We faced the realities of this quarter, too: the struggles of
            isolation and taking calculated risks in hopes of maintaining some
            of the “college experience,” the institutional hurdles of ethnic
            studies departments and the mysterious Board of Trustees. We mourned
            the loss of the programs that were meant to make or break our
            college careers. The resilience of the Northwestern community amazes
            me all the time, and there are still plenty of changes left to be
            made.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now we’re here, at the end of the mag, and I just want to take
            the time to say thank you. Thank you for reading our magazine even
            though we’re not pestering you at the Rock to take a copy or tabling
            at Norris. Thank you to our sources for sharing your thoughts and
            experiences with us. Thank you to this amazing Winter 2021 staff for
            your time, effort and patience with me and my goofy email sign-offs.
            I am so unbelievably proud of the work we’ve done this quarter, and
            I can’t wait to see what NBN does next. I suggest you also keep an
            eye out, dear readers. The best is yet to come.
          </p>

      <p>
        As I write this testimonial half-awake and still a little bit
        Malört-drunk from the night before, my stomach seems to beg for my
        attention, howling and pleading with me as if to say, “Please, never do
        this to me again. Please.” Dear Malört, why did you do this to me? What
        have I done to deserve this?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, where did things go wrong? It is an important question, after all,
        considering in approximately three hours the coroner will be wondering
        the same thing. Maybe it was when I convinced my roommates to join me in
        “Malört shots.” Or maybe it was earlier, when I purchased the barely
        ingestible elixir and could tell that the man behind the counter was
        worried for my overall well-being. “Are you sure you want to do this?”
        his eyes seemed to say. Was my fate decided from that very moment? Dear
        reader, to understand how I got here, we have to go back nine decades,
        to the year 1933.
      </p>
      <p>
        A young man named George Brode had just graduated from what is now known
        as the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, according to his
        1999 obituary in The Chicago Tribune. Soon after graduating, Brode took
        a job at his wife’s family business, D.J. Bielzoff Products Co.
        Meanwhile, in Chicago, a mysterious Swede named Carl Jeppson had been
        selling his alcoholic Malört concoction during Prohibition under the
        pretense that it was a “medicinal” product, according to the “History”
        page on the Malört website. Legend has it that Jeppson’s tastebuds were
        so scorched from severe tobacco abuse that his recipe for Malört was
        actually one of the few things he could taste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after the repeal of Prohibition, Bielzoff Products bought the
        recipe for Malört from Jeppson and began selling it as an alcoholic
        beverage. Although Brode later sold the company, he never parted with
        the rights to Malört. For decades, he marketed the beverage as only for
        drinkers with the strongest of stomachs, eventually bringing the product
        to a level of infamy in Chicago culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who was this man, George Brode, who seemed to be so infatuated with such
        an off-putting drink? Little information is publicly available, other
        than that he was a genius marketer, a lawyer and a Northwestern
        graduate. Only after scanning the Northwestern Archives, public records
        and Ancestry.com did I discover what may very well be the only existing
        picture of George Brode.

        You may be wondering, what does Malört actually taste like? In online
        videos, reviews and even pop culture, the taste has been compared to
        gasoline, pencil shavings and burnt plastic, among other more unpleasant
        things. My favorite description, however, comes from none other than the
        CEO of Malört’s parent company CH Distillery. He is known to describe it
        as “ass, gas and fire.” Yes, that is an exact quote. Let’s break this
        down, shall we?
      </p>
      <img
        src="malort_ass-01.png"
        class="ass media"
        alt="a shot glass with shit in it"
      />
      <p>
        First we have the “ass.” Upon the first few brief moments of initial
        consumption, when the beverage has entered the mouth and made first
        contact with the taste buds, we get strong hints of wormwood, a bitter
        herb often used to flavor drinks like absinthe. This makes sense, as
        wormwood is the only ingredient that the makers of Malört are willing to
        disclose. The initial wormwood taste is bad, but not the worst. It has
        an earthy, funky taste, reminiscent of a root or maybe dirt. At the very
        least, it tastes like something that someone with strange taste may eat.
        I suppose this explains the “ass.”
      </p>
      <img
        src="malort_gas-01.png"
        class="ass media"
        alt="a shot glass with gasoline being poured into it"
      />
      <p>
        Next we have “gas.” This one is pretty straightforward. After swallowing
        the liqueur, the taste of wormwood fades into a strong, biting
        aftertaste which is best described as gasoline. I’ve never actually
        ingested gasoline (thankfully), but I have smelled it. Using my nose as
        a witness, I’ve concluded that this aftertaste must be the closest a
        human can come to sipping your Shell station’s finest petrol. It’s far
        worse than the initial wormwood taste, and the worst part: it doesn’t go
        away. The chemical aftertaste lingers uncomfortably for a good 15
        minutes, just like the last guest at your house party. This is what
        truly causes Malört to be such an intoxicating drink. You don’t want to
        drink more, but instead, you want to drink something — anything — else
        to get this horrible taste out of your mouth. I found myself scrounging
        the kitchen for soda, beer and White Claw just to rid my palate of this
        threat.
      </p>
      <img
        src="malort_fire-01.png"
        class="ass media"
        alt="a shot glass with flames in it set in front of a flaming wooden container"
      />
      <p>
        Finally, we have “fire.” I think this description is less apt for the
        taste and more applicable to the overall experience. The act of drinking
        Malört is very much a dumpster fire. A large, unstoppable dumpster fire
        that spreads from one dumpster to a nearby building before eventually
        engulfing the whole city in catastrophic disaster. Oddly, much like an
        uncontrollable fire, Malört just won’t seem to go away. Even though I
        despised the taste, I found myself craving the beverage after this first
        consumption. The experience of doing Malört shots with friends, as
        unpleasant as it is, is strangely endearing and provides for great
        stories. Stories told, of course, over a nice glass of Malört on the
        rocks.
      </p>

        class="sidebar-image left media2"
        alt="all three of the previous images combined into one image"
      />
      <p>
        Would I recommend Malört? I think that question is inherently flawed.
        It’s like asking someone if they would recommend taking a three-hour
        exam or doing 100 sit-ups; the experience is not enjoyable, but it’s
        worthwhile. Unlike schoolwork and exercise, however, the process of
        drinking Malört is neither productive nor rewarding. And that’s where I
        think the beauty of Malört lies. It’s just another dumb, meaningless,
        painful experience that many — myself included — seem to love. Thank you
        Carl Jeppson, George Brode and the city of Chicago for introducing me to
        such a lovely drink — and a blistering headache that just won’t seem to
        go away.

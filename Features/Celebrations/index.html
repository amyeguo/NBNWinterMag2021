        Face masks are nothing new for Weinberg first- year Kaili Wegener. In
        fact, she started wearing them when she was just 12 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        After she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a rare cancer of the
        lymphatic system, masks became a part of Wegener’s routine. The disease
        compromised her immune system, making exposure to even common viruses
        dangerous. Although Wegener has now been cancer-free for nearly seven
        years, her health remains a primary concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since arriving on campus this winter, Wegener has been taking multiple
        precautions to avoid putting herself and others at risk of COVID-19: She
        eats meals in her room, avoids any large gatherings and wears two masks
        in public. Still, she says those measures don’t always feel like enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ve been hearing things about parties,” Wegener says. “That is really
        concerning to me and extremely disheartening on a personal level as a
        student here. Partying during a pandemic — I just don’t think there’s
        any justification for that. It’s scary.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Following undergraduates’ return to campus between Jan. 3 and Jan. 11,
        COVID-19 positivity rates have hovered between 0.1% and 1.1%. The school
        saw its biggest peak between Feb. 19 and Feb. 25, when 44 undergraduates
        tested positive for the virus. Northwestern’s guidelines currently
        mandate weekly testing requirements for those living off-campus and on
        campus. Those living in on-campus housing must follow Northwestern’s
        COVID-19 policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even so, some students feel that the rules, as well as their
        enforcement, have room for improvement. Medill first-year Joanne Haner
        is particularly concerned about safety inside dining halls, where
        students are allowed to remove their masks to eat together. Haner says
        she feels more comfortable eating in her dorm’s basement.
      </p>

      <img
        class="personright-illo"
        src="assets/person1.png"
        alt="student with mask holding solo cup"
      />
      <p>
        “I’m definitely a little bit surprised at how lenient the dining hall
        is,” Haner says. “I’m happy about it because there’s a sense of
        normalcy, but at the same time, it doesn’t really make sense. I know my
        friends at other schools, all their meals are grab- and-go. I like being
        able to socialize with my friends, but at the same time, it’s not super
        COVID-safe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Julie Payne- Kirchmeier, vice president of Student Affairs,
        dining hall procedures have undergone multiple adjustments over the past
        two quarters, from de- densified seating and reusable Ozzi takeout
        containers to seat reservation systems. After undergraduates returned
        for the winter, Payne- Kirchmeier says staffers noticed that some
        students “weren’t necessarily adhering” to capacity guidelines in
        certain areas of the dining halls, which led to further seating
        restrictions in booth areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, students like Haner who want to avoid the dining hall face a
        dilemma: They aren’t sure where they can and can’t eat. “The RAs are
        very inconsistent about things,” Haner says. “Our friend got written up
        for eating in the basement alone. But then we texted our RA, and we got
        written confirmation that we were allowed to eat there.”
      </p>

        <h4 class="attribution">Kaili Wegener, Weinberg first-year</h4>
      </div>

      <p>
        Medill first-year Ryan Choe has also noticed that in situations where
        rooms are above their specified capacities, RAs often don’t take head
        counts or administer warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It almost indirectly encourages that behavior, because if you don’t
        draw the line, then students don’t really know where to stop,” Choe
        says.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Choe, the system is like a game of telephone: The University sets
        standards and passes them down to administration, which eventually
        relays expectations to RAs. In the end, messages can become garbled,
        potentially giving students the wrong impression.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think the hardest thing about being an RA right now is having the
        guts to call kids out,” Choe says. “That’s not a position that anyone
        wants to find themselves in.”
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Claire*, who has worked in university housing, Choe’s
        assessment is mostly accurate. Last quarter, she says, communication
        from the University was often limited and confusing for workers in
        Residential Services. During the early days of the Wildcat Wellness
        modified quarantine, many employees weren’t even aware that a curfew
        existed for students. Claire* frequently had to defer to her own
        judgment to make decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For RAs, Claire* says that their job during the pandemic is more
        complicated than simply policing their peers. Many rely on their
        positions for living space, food and income, and they must weigh those
        needs against their own health and safety. While knocking on doors to
        check capacity limits, they have to consider the possibility that
        several students could be inside the room with their masks off, putting
        them directly in harm’s way.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You never want to be in a position where you have to choose between
        your living situation and job and your security and health,” she says.

        <p>
          On the morning of Jan. 21, students awoke to find a skull and the word
          “superspreaders” spray-painted on the brick exterior of the Phi Kappa
          Psi fraternity house.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graffiti followed an unsanctioned party hosted that Tuesday by Phi
          Kappa Psi that violated the Interfraternity Council (IFC)’s Code of
          Conduct. According to a statement from the IFC Standards Board, the
          chapter was found responsible for “hosting an unregistered social
          function, for poor representation of the IFC community, for misconduct
          in the recruitment process, for possession of alcohol on chapter
          premises and for violation of the IFC’s public health-oriented social
          event ban.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the event, the IFC fined Phi Kappa Psi $3,500 and banned all
          of its recruitment activities until the end of spring 2021. IFC
          President Nick Papandreou says that students who acted immediately to
          report the event were critical to the success of the investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Phi Psi was one of those cases where the reports came in while the
          event was taking place, so we could intervene accordingly,” Papandreou
          says. “But in general, everything we get we investigate as much as we
          can, and if there’s sufficient evidence, we move on with our
          accountability process.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When Papandreou received reports on the night of the party, he went to
          the house to see the event for himself. Once he realized that there
          were more than 10 students present, he took pictures of the party as
          it was occurring. was occurring. Later, Phi Kappa Psi provided him
          with a list of attendees, and he was able to conduct interviews with
          some of those individuals in order to determine the details of the
          event. But without photo evidence or a source willing to come forward
          and explain the details of a gathering, Papandreou says, the process
          becomes much more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If there’s not enough proof, facts, evidence, it makes it very hard
          to go to a trial like we did with Phi Psi,” Papandreou says.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IFC has received and investigated reports from students about
          other events this quarter, but Phi Kappa Psi is the only Greek house
          that has been sanctioned thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it’s within the IFC’s purview to sanction fraternities, they
          have no control over how the University disciplines the students
          involved in a party. However, Payne-Kirchmeier says there have only
          been a few reports of gatherings since the beginning of the school
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Have we gotten some reports? Sure. Have there been a lot? No,” Payne-
          Kirchmeier says. “Process- wise, any community member can file a
          general concern report, and that comes over to our Dean of Students
          office. If it has specific information in it, such as day, location,
          maybe a picture or two and an address, we follow up right away.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Anna*, a Weinberg second-year living off- campus this quarter, has
          attended several parties and dinners with multiple friend groups since
          classes began. Following one particular night of socializing, she and
          most of her friends contracted COVID-19.
        </p>

        <img
          class="personleft-illo"
          src="assets/person2.png"
          alt="student with mask holding solo cup"
        />
        <p>
          “We took the risk and decided to go to social gatherings, knowing that
          there was a chance we could get [COVID-19],” Anna* says. “We were all
          kind of accepting of that.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning that they had the virus, Anna* and her friends
          quarantined separately for two weeks. Now that they have antibodies,
          she says, they feel even more comfortable hanging out in larger
          groups. “We wanted to have a fun college experience,” Anna says. “Even
          if we were super careful, there would still be the risk of us getting
          it from our apartment building or going out to restaurants. In the
          high-stress environment of school, we wanted to be able to go out to
          eat and do something fun on Friday nights.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When she started to receive complaints about her friend group’s
          behavior from other community members, Anna* was somewhat surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          “People were kind of coming at us and saying things like, ‘There’s a
          pandemic, why are you going out for dinner?’ or ‘People are dying;
          you’re killing people; why are you hanging out with anyone other than
          your roommates?’ It was definitely hard to hear that because I was
          trying to emphasize the role that our mental health was playing in our
          decisions to socialize,” Anna* says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah*, another Weinberg second-year living off- campus, also says her
          stressful workload and isolation have made her feel compelled to
          socialize. She lives with several roommates and has been seeing a
          larger group of about eight friends who sometimes invite other
          acquaintances to join them.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s hard to only do schoolwork and not see other people,” Sarah*
          says. “I think there is a way to see other people and still be
          responsible about it. We’ve kind of just been seeing the same group of
          people to get a change of scenery and socialization. Otherwise, I
          would literally go stir-crazy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Eli Finkel, head of Northwestern’s Relationships and
          Motivation Lab, many adolescents may see the rewards of socializing as
          greater than the risks of contracting COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The benefits of socializing — social bonding, sex — remain intact. In
          fact, insofar as one has been feeling socially deprived, the benefits
          are more powerful than usual,”Finkel says. “More importantly, the
          benefits are immediate and concrete (the fun of beer pong, the
          pleasure of sex), whereas the costs are delayed and abstract (there’s
          a small chance that this get-together will spread the disease).”
        </p>
        <p>
          Finkel says that, as social animals, loneliness can affect humans
          deeply; because college is a time when most students broaden their
          social circles and seek out sexual relationships, it makes sense that
          students have been attempting to socialize extensively. Still, he
          says, it’s possible to have rewarding experiences without violating
          COVID-19 guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The vaccines look very promising, and life is long,” Finkel says.
          “There’s a good chance that this summer will feel reasonably normal.
          On the other hand, people will continue to die in these next few
          months, and it’s within our power to decrease the odds that more
          people die.”

        When Medill first- year Jack* arrived on campus, he and his roommate
        agreed to be “somewhat relaxed” about following COVID-19 guidelines.
        However, it quickly became clear that his roommate had a different
        understanding of“relaxed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, Jack* would return to his room to find that his roommate had
        invited friends over to hang out without masks, and they would remain
        there late into the night.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s a little bit disturbing knowing that we’re existing with so many
        other people, all of whose lives and health are at risk because of all
        of our actions,” Jack* says. “It’s tough, not wanting to be frank and
        confrontational about it, but also making clear that I am uncomfortable
        with the level and nature of activity that’s occurring.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jack*’s roommate continued to allow larger groups of friends into
        their room, Jack* decided that he needed to express his discomfort with
        the situation.

        “Now I feel more able to put my foot down or just discuss something that
        does make me uncomfortable,” Jack* says. “Our relationship is still
        really solid. It’s tough, but there’s no one to really point fingers at
        in this situation, because I know that if people are being
        irresponsible, I have the obligation to report it, be active about it
        and try to fix the situation.”

        Wegener believes the idea that students like Jack* are asked to surveil
        and report their peers is a failure on the part of the University.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I shouldn’t have to report people who are having parties,” Wegener
        says. “I think that that’s the role of the institution.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Other universities, including Yale University and the University of
        North Carolina, have faced backlash for using systems that require
        students to report each other as a means of keeping the virus in check.
        Such measures can allow for the prevention of gatherings or guideline
        violations in the short term. However, they may also create tension
        amongst students who feel that they need to police the behavior of
        others to maintain campus safety. According to Tim Bono, a lecturer in
        Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis,
        shaming in these situations can be counterproductive.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If you point a finger at them and say, ‘Oh, you shouldn’t be doing
        that,’ or you start to shame them, that is likely to backfire,” Bono
        says. “You’re going to be much more successful by gently opening up a
        conversation about the person’s values and goals and drawing attention
        to the ways that their current behaviors might not be conducive to those
        outcomes.”

        Third-year Jess* discovered just how damaging disagreements over the
        pandemic could be when she moved into a house with five friends this
        fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        During their time living together, Jess* was constantly on edge about
        the possibility of contracting COVID-19. She had a job that required her
        to come into contact with small children and elderly members of another
        family, and she didn’t want to endanger them. However, her roommates had
        come to a separate agreement to “make the most” of their Fall Quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jess* frequently expressed her discomfort about the number of people
        invited to the house without masks, the size of her roommates’ friend
        groups and the unsafe indoor activities they were participating in.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I said, ‘I’m really unhappy. I would honestly rather be at work than be
        here sometimes, because I don’t feel heard or seen,’” Jess* says. “I
        wasn’t able to stand up for myself because they were all in agreement
        that what they were doing was fine.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For students experiencing similar situations, Jess* says, health has to
        be the top priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you are living somewhere, that is your safe space,” Jess* says.
        “You should feel like you can exist freely and without fear of bodily
        harm. If you are in a position where you no longer feel that your body
        is safe, you are entitled to leave.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The tipping point came when Jess*’s roommate invited another friend who
        had been socializing extensively into their home without a mask. Jess*
        knew she had to make a decision.

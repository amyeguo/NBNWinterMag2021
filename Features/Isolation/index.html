        <em>M </em>edill first-year Mia Walvoord tried to stay calm when her
        friend texted her about having COVID-19 symptoms the morning after they
        ate dinner together. Once her fear that her friend would test positive
        was confirmed, Walvoord dropped everything and started packing. Later
        that day, she received a phone call from Northwestern University’s COVID
        Response Team, informing her that she was contact-traced and needed to
        relocate to Quarantine and Isolation Housing (Q/I Housing). While she
        had already packed her bags, that didn’t prepare her for the challenges
        isolation would bring.

        Since the start of the pandemic, many students have faced housing
        insecurity and overall anxiety about living situations. When the
        University permitted underclassmen to live on campus during Winter
        Quarter, they were given a list of rules and regulations including
        weekly testing, symptom tracking and socially distancing at least six
        feet apart.

        According to a study published in September 2020 in the Journal of
        Medical Internet Research, the pandemic has negatively impacted college
        students. Circumstances brought by lockdown and stay-at-home orders have
        highlighted the necessity of acknowledging and intervening in students’
        mental health. In the study, 71% of students had increased stress and
        anxiety due to COVID-19. While multiple issues contributed to this
        increase, 89% of the students reported that it was due to difficulty
        concentrating, and 82% of students reported the increased stress came
        from greater concerns about academic performance.

        In a normal year, students worry about arriving to their 9 a.m. class on
        time and fitting a workout class in their schedule. Now, they must
        contend with COVID-19 restrictions, isolation and the risk of
        contracting the virus. While the University has provided students with
        mental health and wellness resources, students are forced to adapt to an
        isolating college experience they couldn’t have predicted or prepared
        for.

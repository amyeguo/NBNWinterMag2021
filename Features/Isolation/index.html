        <em>M </em>edill first-year Mia Walvoord tried to stay calm when her
        friend texted her about having COVID-19 symptoms the morning after they
        ate dinner together. Once her fear that her friend would test positive
        was confirmed, Walvoord dropped everything and started packing. Later
        that day, she received a phone call from Northwestern University’s COVID
        Response Team, informing her that she was contact-traced and needed to
        relocate to Quarantine and Isolation Housing (Q/I Housing). While she
        had already packed her bags, that didn’t prepare her for the challenges
        isolation would bring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the start of the pandemic, many students have faced housing
        insecurity and overall anxiety about living situations. When the
        University permitted underclassmen to live on campus during Winter
        Quarter, they were given a list of rules and regulations including
        weekly testing, symptom tracking and socially distancing at least six
        feet apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to a study published in September 2020 in the Journal of
        Medical Internet Research, the pandemic has negatively impacted college
        students. Circumstances brought by lockdown and stay-at-home orders have
        highlighted the necessity of acknowledging and intervening in students’
        mental health. In the study, 71% of students had increased stress and
        anxiety due to COVID-19. While multiple issues contributed to this
        increase, 89% of the students reported that it was due to difficulty
        concentrating, and 82% of students reported the increased stress came
        from greater concerns about academic performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a normal year, students worry about arriving to their 9 a.m. class on
        time and fitting a workout class in their schedule. Now, they must
        contend with COVID-19 restrictions, isolation and the risk of
        contracting the virus. While the University has provided students with
        mental health and wellness resources, students are forced to adapt to an
        isolating college experience they couldn’t have predicted or prepared
        for.

          in contact with someone who tested positive to relocate to designated
          quarantine and isolation dorms until their symptoms subside. Students
          are usually allowed back to their regular residences after 10 to 14
          days.</span

        <span

          contact with someone who tested positive, she was required to move
          into Foster-Walker (Plex) on Feb. 16. When she received the initial
          phone call from her case manager about the move, Walvoord thought she
          was ready to handle whatever information came her way. But Walvoord
          wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the amount of information she would have to
          take in.</span

          us, like this is when you would get out if you test negative, this is
          when you would get out if you test positive. It was just a lot of
          information to take in the span of 10 minutes,&rdquo; Walvoord
          says.</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >Walvoord says that communication with the University throughout her
          time in isolation could have been better. During her daily wellness
          calls, Walvoord felt the information given to her did not do much to
          help. Sometimes, she and her friends would have multiple people
          calling and providing different information.</span

          can&rsquo;t answer that for you, you have to wait for this person to
          call you because that&rsquo;s a different department&rsquo; ... It
          causes a lot of extra stress to not have information,&rdquo; Walvoord
          says. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know who to trust or who to follow, and
          we just wanted to be respectful of University guidelines and not make
          a mistake that could harm us or anybody.&rdquo;</span

          non-fitted sheet &mdash; which barely covers the bed &mdash; to tuck
          under the mattress. Walvoord remembers feeling grateful for bringing
          her own sheets and being spared the inconvenience of using the
          University-provided ones. During her stay, the University offered a
          flyer with resources for students, such as work-out equipment,
          coloring books and numbers for services, like the NU Health Service
          and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).</span

          to receive further counseling. The exception to this is if an
          individual needs to schedule a crisis appointment within 24 to 48
          hours. The CAPS website currently provides resources that link to PDFs
          or websites for pandemic-related stressors like remote learning,

          to quarantine housing due to their exposure to Raad &mdash; before
          calling the after-hours nurse at NU Health Service around midnight to
          tell her about her results. Raad was told she couldn&rsquo;t be moved
          to Plex until the next morning and didn&rsquo;t receive a call from

          pains and coughing. Concerns about virus-related complications arose,
          and Raad was taken to the ER for scans and blood tests. The tests
          returned normal, taking a weight off of Raad&rsquo;s shoulders, but
          when she returned to Plex, the halls felt as empty as when she

          With fewer rules, no RAs and much more freedom, students tend to look
          forward to moving past Northwestern&rsquo;s two-year on-campus
          residency requirement. But with COVID-19 still weighing heavily on
          students, living off-campus presents its own challenges, especially
          when one roommate contracts the virus. Some students sharing
          off-campus housing have created rules and restricted social
          interactions to lessen the chance of contracting COVID-19.</span

          her bedroom for the required 10- day quarantine period. After
          receiving her positive test results but no phone calls from the
          University, Schultz took it upon herself to inform those around her

          has 17.6k followers, he answered questions about the virus and
          connected with others who had tested positive. Mahesh wanted to use
          his platform to counteract the narrative that most young adults
          contract the virus through super-spreader events.</span

          >Throughout Fall Quarter, Mahesh had been seeing a CAPS provider for
          mental health. While he didn&rsquo;t discuss COVID-19 much with his
          provider, he did bring up the additional familial stress he had been
          under due to catching the virus. Eventually, Mahesh turned to
          friendships for support instead of the University, believing that he
          couldn&rsquo;t rely on the school.</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >In response to the ever-growing stressors students face during the
          pandemic, the University has sent emails to the student body with
          resources. At the beginning of Winter Quarter, Julie Payne-Kirchmeier,
          VP for Student Affairs, sent Northwestern students a &ldquo;Welcome,
          Wildcats!&rdquo; email with links to University resources for
          financial assistance, Northwestern Career Advancement, testing and
          COVID-19 safety and more. While it wasn&rsquo;t specifically related
          to mental health, there was a wellness section listing resources, like
          CAPS, that are often included in the administration&rsquo;s emails to
          students. Walvoord and her friends were interested in using CAPS
          during Winter Quarter, but soon discovered that the CAPS calendar was
          completely booked for the foreseeable future. As a result, she
          &ldquo;just kind of gave up on the idea.&rdquo;</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >&ldquo;I understand Northwestern might have limited resources for
          people to talk to you, but that&rsquo;s just not ideal for someone who
          is being proactive and looking to get help to be denied that because
          of scheduling,&rdquo; Walvoord says.</span

      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >Walvoord did not use any mental health resources while she was in
          quarantine housing, but she was more than ready to go back to her own
          room by the end of her isolation period.</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >&ldquo;I was very excited. It replicated that feeling of coming onto
          campus the first time,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Because everything felt
          new again, I&rsquo;ve just gained a new appreciation for being on
          campus.&rdquo;</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >Still, scheduling with the University continued to be a problem for
          Walvoord during her move- out process, which she says was far from
          ideal and colored with confusion and stress. Before moving out of
          Plex, Walvoord and her friends received calls giving them clearance to
          leave at very different times of day. Her ride back to her dorm,
          provided by the University, had not been confirmed, and despite
          multiple attempts, she was not able to get a moving crate to transport
          her items to the downstairs lobby. After calling to inquire about the
          crate and waiting for one for close to an hour, Walvoord had to carry
          her items by herself.</span

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span
          >While Walvoord was &ldquo;super grateful&rdquo; to have gotten a ride
          back to her dorm at the conclusion of her quarantine, she was still
          stressed about her schoolwork and moving back into her room while her
          roommate awaited her arrival. When she tried to get into her room, her
          Wildcard didn&rsquo;t work, forcing her to get a temporary keycard.
          She later found out that her card had not been cleared until hours
          after she left Plex.</span

          >As a student starting college remotely, Walvoord was simply happy to
          be on campus, meet new people and feel more connected to the
          Northwestern community. She felt grateful for the everyday experiences
          of being a student on campus, whether it was picking up food at the
          dining hall or walking by the lakefront. After living in the
          quarantine dorms and being deprived of these small joys, she sought to
          reclaim that gratitude for the sake of her mental health and overall
          college experience.</span

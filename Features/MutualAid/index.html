        Braving the Evanston cold, members of Students Organizing for Labor
        Rights (SOLR) huddled outside of the Davis Purple Line Station around a
        single table, hoping to collect Personal Protective Equipment and winter
        essentials for Northwestern University’s service workers. They were
        unaware of how many donations they would receive by the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The afternoon of Nov. 13, 2020 was SOLR’s first Mutual Aid Supplies
        Distribution event. Student members laughed off the sharpness of the
        wind and the noise of nearby buses to keep their spirits high. Passersby
        who stopped, curious as to why students were standing in the cold, were
        met with an introduction to SOLR’s mutual aid efforts. The tabling, SOLR
        members told them, was to support the workers who had been furloughed by
        the University last March.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the event faced a slow start, by the end of the three-hour long
        fundraiser, the table was covered with donations that spilled onto the
        sidewalk. Items ranged from handmade hats and scarves donated by
        students from Knitwestern, Northwestern's knitting club, to lightly-used
        coats and blankets — equipping SOLR with supplies to better support
        workers who, at the time of the event, had been laid off for eight
        months. Tabling events, along with petitions and mutual aid funds, all
        contribute to SOLR’s mutual aid efforts to support community members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutual aid, in its simplest terms, is a mutually beneficial, voluntary
        exchange of goods and services rooted in community care. Organizations
        like SOLR turn to mutual aid when existing institutions fail to meet the
        needs that they identify in their communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practice of mutual aid has always been tied to social justice
        movements, especially those concerning Black liberation. When a
        population is in need, most commonly one that has been historically and
        systemically oppressed, mutual aid works around existing barriers to
        provide a support network. Today, mutual aid has become integral to day-
        to-day functioning of organizations at Northwestern and in cities across
        the U.S., offering alternatives to the less efficient systems of support
        that exist within the status quo.

      <h5><mark>Wildcats give back</mark></h5>
      <p>
        When Weinberg third-year Abbey Zhu joined her high school’s Equity and
        Inclusion Team, she expected an opportunity to push for meaningful
        policy changes to her school’s environment. Instead, she found herself
        endlessly discussing the harmful culture rather than helping to remedy
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was really infuriating to know I was part of this superficial team
        that had no power, but it also felt like there were no other avenues to
        force the school to acknowledge and reckon with its racism and realize
        that change was necessary,” Zhu says. “I wanted to expose how racist and
        violent my classmates, teachers and school were, but obviously
        everything we did as a team was superficial.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t until Zhu arrived at Northwestern that she was able to seek
        out organizations that embodied her values, and by her second year, she
        became a committed member of SOLR.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I joined SOLR honestly because a lot of my friends were in SOLR in my
        first year at Northwestern ... and because they’re doing such integral
        work on campus to make sure our service workers are being treated with
        dignity,” Zhu says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although a March 2020 news release by the University claimed that they
        would use federal funds to compensate workers, workers say they never
        saw any funding distributed to them after they lost their income, health
        insurance and benefits. This led SOLR to step in.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s only so much SOLR can do, which is why we’re asking
        Northwestern and Compass to do more because they are multi-billion
        dollar corporations,” Zhu says.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Zhu, workers are still in need of greater financial support
        in order to fulfill basic needs like rent, food and utilities. Now, she
        says students and other members of the community must take it upon
        themselves to support workers until Northwestern takes accountability
        for its actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOLR has worked in coalition with other Northwestern organizations, like
        the Northwestern University Graduate Workers (NUGW), to advance both of
        their causes. According to NUGW’s website, their organization is an
        “antiracist, feminist labor union that advocates for better working and
        living conditions for all graduate workers,” with a focus on
        “historically excluded and underrepresented graduate students.” NUGW has
        attempted to push for change by petitioning the University’s
        administration. It now works with other student-run campus organizations
        like SOLR and Northwestern University Community Not Cops, a student
        organization advocating for the abolition of policing on Northwestern’s
        campus and investment into the student body and surrounding communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some members of NUGW have previous experience with mutual aid networks,
        including fourth-year PhD candidate Ally Reith. Reith says she and her
        partner dedicated themselves to helping people across Chicago prior to
        joining NUGW, explaining that their involvement wasn’t necessarily tied
        to a specific organization, but rather to larger community networks in
        the city. Whenever she had the chance, Reith would use her car to pick
        up items, such as furniture or produce, and drop them off to any
        residents that requested them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The simplicity of it for me speaks to the value of community care and
        justice, and recognizing that if I have something I can give, I’m sure
        there’s someone that has the need for it,” Reith says. “Having a mutual
        aid network removes all of the bureaucratic red tape and access
        barriers. It simplifies that exchange in a way that I think is
        beautiful.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Reith became involved with NUGW last March and says that the
        organization has mutual aid embedded in its infrastructure, since
        serving the collective and providing relief to the community are some of
        the union’s main goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Being able to give immediate relief to folks that need it is one of the
        strongest elements of our organization, in my opinion,” Reith says. “We
        are able to give immediate relief and sustain pressure on the University
        because, of course, these things and services shouldn’t be on students
        to be providing. It’s the University’s job. So we exist to fill where
        they abandon us.”

        This June, amid the Black Lives Matter protests, Chicago resident Nita
        Tennyson opened her phone to a Facebook post that would ignite a
        powerful chain reaction. It was about baby formula. This particular post
        said that because of recent lootings, stores that would typically carry
        formula were either closed or stripped of supplies, making the product
        difficult to acquire. Tennyson has dreamed of providing care for her
        community since she was a child. Her career aspirations included
        becoming a youth probation officer, a teacher and the founder of a youth
        center. Whatever the future held, she wanted to give back to Englewood
        and Chatham, the neighborhoods she grew up in. The Facebook post was the
        push she needed to make her dreams a reality, which came in the form of
        her mutual aid organization, Nita’s Love Train. “What specifically made
        me start the Love Train was the day of the lootings, it was just a lot
        of negativity, a lot of bad things going on ... I had extra stuff so I
        was like, ‘There’s a lot of negativity. I should just go outside and be
        positive, so that’s what I’m gonna do,’” Tennyson says. The founding
        principle of Tennyson’s organization is to provide individuals and
        families throughout Chicago with immediate provisions they otherwise
        would not be able to afford, and the name is a reference to how each
        area she visits is like a “new stop to show people love.” The Love Train
        began as several local pop-ups where individuals could pick up the items
        they needed, though the winter weather caused Tennyson to switch to a
        delivery method. Typically, she delivers packages that contain a week’s
        worth of necessities, ranging from diapers and baby formula to blankets
        and clothes — all things she considers to be mutual aid. “Mutual aid
        could be books ... Mutual aid could be art,” Tennyson says. “Just
        because you’re giving people actual items doesn’t mean you’re not giving
        them as much love as you can, because people also need to have grievance
        circles, and healing circles, and hugs and all types of stuff because
        there’s a lot going on in our society.” Like Tennyson, Washington
        Heights resident Ahriel Fuller became involved with mutual aid as a
        direct response to the “opportunity desperation” she witnessed during
        the recent summer’s protests. Her mutual aid organization, now known as
        $$FREE.99, first started as a result of a donation collection she
        organized that flooded her mother’s home with supplies. As a result,
        Fuller began her own pop-up shop, centered around sustainability and
        providing free goods to those in need in her community. “I decided to
        come up with a solution. I didn’t even have a name for it first. I just
        started collecting supplies, Pampers, wipes, formulas, and that’s really
        what it started with ... I got a very great and heavy response from the
        community,” Fuller says. The $$FREE.99 Community Store, Fuller’s name
        for the initial pop-ups, formed as a result of the voluntary efforts of
        its organizer and her community. Fuller says that because people were
        willing to donate their time and cars and spread the word, the store was
        able to take off. Now, $$FREE.99 aims to provide individuals with basic
        essentials like feminine hygiene products, household cleaning products
        and goods for those raising babies and adolescents. “We can’t depend on
        this system to give us what we need, so let’s just do it for ourselves,
        do what we can,” Fuller says. “This is how every movement for Black
        bodies has been successful ... Without mutual aid, a lot of things in
        history wouldn’t have been accomplished. It’s a necessity.” Fuller wants
        to focus on making $$FREE.99 a more permanent establishment where
        sustainable practices can be encouraged. Those new systems would include
        recycling goods and incorporating brick-and-mortar trading posts —
        essentially store-fronts that allow residents to barter for goods and
        services rather than using credit or cash. “All throughout history our
        ancestors keep showing us that it’s gotta be us, that’s the only way
        we’re gonna be alright. We have to take care of us. That’s the only way
        we’re gonna get love — it’s if we love us,” Fuller says. While
        Tennyson’s and Fuller’s mutual aid efforts began due to social movements
        in the city, the coronavirus pandemic has acted as a catalyst for other
        mutual aid initiatives in Chicago. Since Illinois saw its first rise in
        coronavirus cases in March 2020, 23-year-old Logan Square resident Mika
        Deshmukh began actively searching for ways to support her community. So,
        when a local artist introduced her to The Love Fridge, a Chicago-based
        mutual aid organization, Deshmukh saw it as an act of fate to do work
        she had been passionate about since 2019: tackling food injustice. With
        24 fridges in 18 neighborhoods across Chicago, The Love Fridge strives
        to battle food inequity by filling refrigerators with fresh produce and
        ensuring these fridges are attainable in both location and
        accessibility, allowing residents to take goods practically anonymously.
        “I think it’s this whole... difference in worldview: Are you thinking
        about your individual wealth and well-being and success, or are you
        thinking about your community’s wealth, well-being and success?”
        Deshmukh says. Deshmukh and other Love Fridge organizers have been able
        to form relationships with local residents and activists, contributing
        to The Love Fridge’s community care. Deshmukh says that because Love
        Fridges are either sponsored by local businesses, community centers or
        individual hosts that are already engaged with community organizing
        efforts in their neighborhoods, the organization can successfully engage
        in community care. “Nonprofits are often centered around philanthropy or
        charity, and that’s not something we want to do,” Deshmukh says. “We
        want it to be a sustainable relationship, as we say, ‘nourishing our
        community.’ We want to make our initiatives have a life cycle and be
        sustainable in the communities.” This past December, the organization
        launched their “Full Circle” initiative, where they partnered with local
        community restaurants and chefs to provide prepared meals in the
        fridges. This way, houseless residents can access nourishing food, and
        restaurants that have struggled as a result of the pandemic also receive
        support. “Mutual aid is caring for your community, and by caring for
        your community you are trusting that your community will also be there
        for you,” Deshmukh says. “I really feel like that’s the fundamental
        idea... removing this imposed scarcity and isolation.”

      <h5><mark>The need for mutual effort</mark></h5>
      <p>
        Despite the current popularity of mutual aid efforts, student and local
        organizers alike worry about the sustainability of future initiatives.
        Since the initial flood of supplies that came in the aftermath of the
        first protests in support of George Floyd, Fuller has noticed a
        significant decline in donations, which means the burden of donating has
        fallen upon the members of her community that are themselves in need of
        support. “In the beginning there were a lot more donations coming in,
        and that’s because a lot of people looked at it as a one-time donation,”
        Fuller says. “People are real receptive naturally, especially Black
        people. Those are the people keeping momentum. Non-Black people haven’t
        donated since their first time or refuse to answer emails or their
        phones. A lot of Black people are generous, but it be the people that
        have the least that are giving the most.” Tennyson has similar worries.
        Although she feels fortunate to continue to receive donations from her
        immediate networks and communities, she recognizes that many of the
        burdens associated with sustaining mutual aid work eventually fall on
        Black people and low-income individuals. “No matter how much we educate
        someone, it’s up to them to decide to participate and show love,”
        Tennyson says. “We can post every day what we’re going through on social
        media, we can write a book about it, we could put up a video showing
        exactly the traumas and different situations we face everyday, but no
        matter how many likes, no matter how many retweets and shares we get, it
        has to be up to a person to look at this and decide they want to show
        love. There’s only so much we can say to get people to show up.” Zhu has
        also seen declines in student body support of SOLR since the beginning
        of the school year. Low- income and working class students, who aren’t
        able to make sustainable donations to the greater SOLR fund, are facing
        the greatest burdens of contributing to mutual aid efforts. “Workers
        continuously need financial support, and it’s unfair to be asking
        low-income folks to keep donating to us when there are a lot of wealthy
        students at Northwestern who could be monthly donors to SOLR and
        contributing more than $20 a month without it hurting them or their
        family financially,” Zhu says. Although the organization continues to
        petition the University to take accountability for its actions and
        support essential workers, Zhu says that this is a continuous battle
        that might not be resolved in the near future. Additionally, Zhu
        believes there’s a notion that the struggles service workers have faced
        are waning. In her eyes, affluent individuals that donate once are
        merely using their contribution to check a box rather than engaging with
        an ongoing effort. “There’s a notion that the violence has stopped, a
        sense that these are exceptions, when we know that this is the norm:
        that Northwestern has never cared for its dining workers, that they have
        never paid them enough or treated them with dignity, and justified them
        being laid off because they’re not seen as integral to the community or
        deserving of financial stability,” Zhu says. “These are not emergencies,
        this is the norm for dining workers.” Although Deshmukh doesn’t think
        sustainability is an urgent concern for The Love Fridge because of the
        influx in donations the organization continues to receive, she does
        worry that mutual aid may be experiencing a momentary “explosion” in
        popularity due to the pandemic. Yet even with these worries, she’s
        hoping that the recent spotlight on mutual aid efforts will encourage
        people to prioritize community care as a regular practice. “I hope for a
        day that we don’t need mutual aid, but I don’t have enough faith in the

        hope community care is more commonplace and not politicized or
        considered leftist. Because what is political about caring about your
        community? I don’t think it’s a matter of politics, it’s a matter of
        love.”

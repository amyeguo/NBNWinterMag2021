                Deering Meadow
            </p>
          <p>
            To many, Deering Meadow is one of the prettiest places
            on Northwestern’s campus. According to Communication 
            second-year Kelly Killorin, it is also the best spot 
            to build a snowman. After the first big snowfall of 
            January 2021, Killorin and her friends found that 
            Deering Meadow, with its trees wrapped in lights, 
            was the perfect place to play in the snow at night.
            According to Killorin, the experience made her 
            reminisce about the winter before.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was my first time seeing the lights lit up again 
            since I was on campus freshman year,” she says. 
          </p>
          <p>
            They made a bunch of snowballs and had a big 
            snowball fight, which made Killorin nostalgic. 
          </p>
         
          <p>
            “It was just the happiest thing ever,” she says. “I felt like a kid.”
          </p>

          <p>
            When constructing their snowmen, Killorin made the bases easily, 
            impressing her friends and giving tips as they built them. 
            They made two snowmen with sticks for arms and Killorin’s 
            friend placed her hat on one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterward, Killorin and her friends took photos of 
            their creations with Deering Library, the trees and 
            lights in the background.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All night, we were just admiring how pretty it was. 
            I feel like I grew a lot closer with the friends 
            that were there,” Killorin says.

                Kellogg Global Hub
            </p>
          <p>
            The Kellogg Global Hub opened for the first time in March 2017. 
            For Shea Christian, a Weinberg fourth-year, it quickly became 
            one of her favorite places to do work on campus. It was the 
            perfect spot for her to stay focused when studying.
          </p>
      
         <p>
            “The well-dressed people and the aura of industry and 
            professionalism always drove me to finish assignments in 
            record time,” Christian says. “I knew immediately that this 
            was the perfect place to keep myself on track.”
         </p>
         <p>
            She spent countless Sundays in Kellogg staring at her computer, 
            and the buzz of the building inspired her to remain motivated. 
            It became a place Christian always knew she could go to if she 
            was stressed and she could reliably get things done.
         </p>
         <p>
            Kellogg was not just a place to study and work. When Christian 
            worked in a psychology lab over the summer, it was an ideal 
            spot to have lunch or relax in the middle of the day.
         </p>
         <p>
            “I remember sitting on the Kellogg porch in the summertime 
            feeling the breeze coming in from the lake and enjoying the view,”
             Christian says. “It always made me feel so lucky to be at Northwestern.”

                Kresge Courtyard
            </p>
          <p>
            Photo shoots are always something Communication third-year 
            Grace Frome looks forward to. They’ve been a fun part of her 
            Northwestern experience since she started doing them with 
            friends her freshman year. Each photo shoot takes place at 
            a new location, and Frome’s favorite was one she did at the 
            garden courtyard between Kresge and Crowe Hall which her 
            friend showed her.
          </p>
         <p>
            “We turned the other way and it just opens up into this 
            beautiful, empty courtyard. I had no idea that it ever existed,” Frome says.
         </p>
      
          <p>
            Once there, Frome knew the photos would turn out great. 
            The weather was perfect – clear and sunny. Frome remembers 
            watching her friend take advantage of the surroundings by 
            climbing a stair banister to reach a tree so he would be 
            framed by the leaves.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            “There are so many beautiful places all around campus, 
            and I love it, getting to see people interact with these 
            surroundings and really feel themselves and find beauty 
            and happiness in the space,” Frome says.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back at the photos always makes Frome happy. 
            She won’t ever forget that day in the courtyard. For 
            her, those photos are among the best she’s ever taken.

                The Lakefill
            </p>
          <p>
            The lakefill is a special spot for many Northwestern students. 
            Claire Bugos, a Medill class of ‘20 alum, remembers it fondly, 
            especially when she watched the sunrise for the final time 
            this past summer. Coming from California, the outdoors has 
            been a big part of her life, so having a natural body of 
            water like Lake Michigan nearby was something she found 
            comfort in.
          </p>
       
          <p>
            On the walk to the lake with her friends, they noticed 
            how it was a perfect sunrise. The clouds were wispy, 
            mixed with purple and pink hues, and the sun rose as they 
            sat by the rock that Bugos and her friends had painted 
            the night before.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            While watching the sun come up, there was a mixed martial 
            arts group simultaneously having a celebration.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            “They were all lined up with these big drums and as the sun 
            rose they were beating their drums and cheering making music,” 
            Bugos says. “And it was a total accident but it just made our 
            experience feel so much more meaningful because you have 
            this drumline for just you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For Bugos, it was almost like the music was a perfect 
            send-off for her time at Northwestern.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I was feeling really nostalgic because it was like the 
            second to last weekend before I was going to be gone,” 
            Bugos says. “I was definitely present taking in all the 
            beauty of the campus.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For Bugos, it was a moment of nostalgia and a way to say 
            goodbye to a place she had called home for the past four 
            years. It will always be something she’ll remember.

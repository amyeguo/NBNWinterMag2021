      <p>
        Last winter, McCormick second-year Caroline Harms walked from Willard to
        Tech five days a week. Her 15-minute trek involved cutting through Plex,
        crossing a parking lot and walking up Sheridan Road before reaching her
        destination: 11 a.m. Engineering Analysis. Learning remotely, Harms’
        commute is now just a few steps across her dorm room, from her bed to
        her desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the numerous drawbacks associated with online learning —
        technical difficulties, distracting home lives and screen fatigue, to
        name a few — students like Harms are finding just as many upsides, like
        the ability to wake up five minutes before class. Athletes can now join
        Zoom calls from the bus or hotel, making it easier to keep up with
        course material. What’s more, some students with learning disabilities
        say their educational experience improves significantly with increased
        privacy and individual interactions with professors.
      </p>
      <p>
        During her first year, Harms chose to live on South Campus because of
        its community feel, but rushing across campus from class to class
        consumed valuable time in her already-busy engineering major schedule.
        Though most of her classes took place in Tech, Harms says one was in
        Harris, which was a stressful walk to make in a short amount of time.
        Because of the virtual environment this quarter, she says she has used
        her spare time to get involved in activities she couldn’t enjoy while
        things were in-person, like editorial positions on the Northwestern
        Undergraduate Research Journal and Helicon Literary & Arts Magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I [thought] I physically can't get there at this time, or I have things
        to do elsewhere on campus,” Harms says. “That's not really a problem
        anymore.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit of the remote learning atmosphere is the ability to
        review lecture material. Harms says she likes “the idea of recorded
        lectures,” as she can return to concepts if her mind wanders the first
        time they are presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the pandemic, some of her professors even recorded office hours,
        which she says helps especially when there are time constraints
        preventing her from attending.
      </p>
      <p>
        SESP second-year Olivia Haskins plays volleyball for Northwestern. She
        also says the virtual environment gives her greater academic
        accessibility, especially during season, when the team is often on the
        road. Haskins recalled feeling rushed last winter going from practice to
        her dorm then to class. She says virtual classes are “a time saver” this
        winter, as her team travels every other weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Haskins says she appreciates asynchronous classes for the
        flexibility they offer. This winter, she enrolled in Anthropology 201,
        which she wouldn’t have been able to take in an in-person environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Having asynchronous classes has been really cool because there’s a lot
        of classes that are only taught in the morning that I usually can't take
        with practice,” Haskins says. “But now, a lot of them are asynchronous,
        so I can still take the class. I don’t have to worry about missing the
        classroom or missing practice. I can just do them whenever I want.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Increased flexibility is especially important for students with learning
        differences, including Weinberg first- year Nia Robles. They have also
        enjoyed access to recorded lectures, which allow them to take class when
        their attention is most focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        “[As] a person who has difficulties with language and attention, being
        able to rewatch things is something that I found extremely helpful,”
        Robles says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Robles says the remote learning environment is more
        conducive to navigating an anxiety disorder. They say Zoom classes can
        allow for increased privacy during their most difficult classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I think everyone has those classes [where] you’re like, ‘Why am I
        here?’ that make you feel less worthy,” Robles says. “Because that can
        trigger anxiety, many people have a new opportunity to be able to turn
        off your camera.”
      </p>
      <p>
        During a panic attack, Robles turns off their computer camera and takes
        a moment to get a drink of water and breathe before reengaging with the
        class. Even communicating with professors about anxiety can be easier
        with remote learning, they say. At in-person office hours, another
        student might be able to overhear a conversation taking place. The
        privacy of a Zoom room chat takes away that concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Sometimes you want privacy,” Robles says. “You want the privacy to tell
        a professor, ‘I’m struggling with this.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        When moving back to in-person classes, Robles hopes to carry these
        aspects of the remote environment with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim Stachowiak, Director of Assistive Technology and Assistant Director
        of Accessible NU, says a lot can be learned from the time college
        students spend learning remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I haven’t talked to anybody who says that they necessarily like remote
        learning,” Stachowiak says. “But the positive aspects of remote learning
        and the biggest positive we’ve seen... is more flexibility.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the last year, Accessible NU has continued its mission of
        supporting and empowering students with disabilities and ensuring equal
        access to full participation in the academic environment. Stachowiak
        says some aspects of the virtual learning environment have helped
        students continue to receive the accommodations they need. Online, it’s
        still easy to allow for extra time on exams and flexible deadlines.
        Relaxed attendance policies, for example, help those with flexible
        attendance accommodations.

      <p>
        At the beginning of the pandemic, Stachowiak served on a team that
        taught Foundations of Online Teaching to over 700 Northwestern
        professors. The course emphasized one of Accessible NU’s key values,
        regardless of the learning environment, called Universal Design for
        Learning (UDL).
      </p>
      <p>
        “[UDL] is really about identifying barriers that exist for everyone, not
        just disabilities, and removing them by providing options to learning,”
        Stachowiak says.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Stachowiak, the pandemic has made professors more aware of
        many barriers that exist for students. For example, providing captions
        in videos eliminates barriers for the hearing impaired and students for
        whom English is a second language. Stachowiak says remote learning has
        opened up people’s eyes to UDL and the ways in-person classrooms can be
        more accessible to all students, regardless of ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When we taught instructors about this in Foundations of Online
        Teaching, we were constantly pushing these concepts can still apply when
        we come back into the classroom setting,” Stachowiak says.
      </p>
      <p>
        He believes that remote learning has also pushed digital accessibility
        to the forefront of the public’s attention. With nearly all classes and
        activities taking place online, everyone in the community must be
        provided with digital access to material. When most people are engaging
        with the online environment, the need for equal availability of
        resources becomes clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We can make little adjustments to certain areas that can benefit lots
        of different groups,” Stachowiak says. “[Adjustments that can] benefit
        people with different learning styles, that can benefit people with
        different ability levels [and] that can benefit people from different
        cultural backgrounds, just by making some minor shifts in how we provide
        information and how we allow students to express what they learn.”

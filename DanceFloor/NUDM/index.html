      <p>
        Between March 4 and March 6, more than 800 Northwestern students
        participated in trivia bowls, TikTok challenges, yoga classes and
        various other virtual events, all of which were a part of a 2021 Dance
        Marathon characterized by less dancing than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 1975, the student organization Northwestern University Dance
        Marathon (NUDM) spends each year fundraising for a beneficiary. Since
        the early 1980s, their annual efforts have culminated in a “Dance
        Marathon,” in which thousands of dancers crowd into a large tent and
        dance for 30 consecutive hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and the campus-wide movement
        to abolish Northwestern Greek life associated with the National
        Panhellenic Association and Interfraternity Council, the 2021 Dance
        Marathon underwent a number of changes to adhere to pandemic safety
        guidelines and distance itself from Greek life. NUDM de-emphasized its
        traditional team fundraising system, took place remotely and was
        restructured to incorporate a mixture of dancing and other bonding
        activities spread over the course of three days.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was definitely strange to do the whole thing online, especially
        since I’ve never participated in an in-person one,” says Medill
        first-year Alexa Crowder, who serves on NUDM’s Marketing and Media
        Committee. “Our two emcees danced on a livestream from a stage on campus
        each of the three nights, [but] I didn’t do too much myself because I
        was alone in my room across the country.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This new format was more interactive than the 2020 Dance Marathon, which
        consisted of a series of videos that students could watch on their own
        time, due to Northwestern administration’s cancellation of the live
        event three days prior.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We were sad that work putting up a tent and planning for the entire
        marathon was going to go to waste,” says Cami Steppe, a SESP fourth-
        year and NUDM executive co-chair. “Looking back, it was obviously the
        right decision to happen a year ago to keep everyone in our community
        safe.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, even with more preparation time, NUDM executive members found
        that planning a virtual event made it difficult to connect with and
        recruit students. Rather than advertise to potential dancers in dining
        halls and dorms, NUDM turned to social media and outreach via student
        organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It has been a really challenging year for fundraising, if we’re being
        honest, as it has been with every nonprofit organization we’ve talked
        to,” Steppe says. “We have fewer dancers than we usually have, but
        that’s expected.”
      </p>
      <p>
        NUDM participants raised a total of $674,375, most of which will be
        donated to Compass to Care, a Chicago- based organization that supports
        the families of children with cancer. Even though this total is lower
        than last year ’s $1,029,366, Ayesha Goswamy, a Weinberg fourth-year and
        executive co- chair of NUDM, is unsurprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Although this is slightly smaller than years past, we were still proud
        of the people we were able to engage,” Goswamy says. “Our numbers also
        showed that, on average, we fundraised more per dancer than in the past.
        We were happy with how the event went and that people attended our
        events even through the Zoom fatigue of classes and meetings.”
      </p>
      <p>
        She attributes the fundraising difference to the pandemic, the virtual
        format and NUDM’s changes in response to the movement to abolish Greek
        life. Ever since the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity co-founded NUDM
        alongside the Associated Student Government, NUDM has had a close
        relationship with Greek life. However, in recent years, NUDM has been
        open to altering this relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We’re really excited about making substantial change in tandem with the
        Abolish Greek Life movement,” Steppe says. “We are proud that
        Northwestern has really faced the Greek system head- on and is dealing
        with all the issues that Greek life brings to campus... In seeing all
        these conversations, we were like, ‘We cannot continue to support these
        Greek organizations in the way we have in the past.’”
      </p>
      <p>
        Among these changes is the implementation of a flexible fundraising
        goal. In previous years, dancers had a $400 minimum fundraising goal;
        this year, they were encouraged to set their own target and simply raise
        as much as they could. Although NUDM’s executive board was concerned
        that this might lower their overall fundraising total, they agreed it
        would benefit dancers from low-income backgrounds and those impacted by
        the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everyone is in such a different place financially this year, and we
        just don’t want anyone to have the additional stressor of DM
        fundraising,” Goswamy says. “We want DM fundraising to be a positive
        experience, and we believe that any amount that they could contribute to
        our beneficiary is having a positive impact.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from the new flexible fundraising goal, NUDM also altered its
        traditional fundraising structure, which previously allowed Greek
        organizations to fundraise in large teams. To encourage the breakdown of
        these teams, NUDM asked them to change their names rather than entering
        under the name of a Greek organization. Multicultural Greek
        organizations and student organizations were also invited to form teams,
        and NUDM allowed solo dancers unaffiliated with Greek life or a
        participating student organization to join the Northwestern University
        Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everyone just followed [the team] structure because it was the norm,”
        says Medill fourth-year Lindsey Lubowitz, the co-chair of NUDM’s
        Marketing and Media committee. “The big teams were usually the Greek
        teams, but this year, there’s a lot less team structure, and the teams
        are a lot smaller.”
      </p>
      <p>
        According to a member of the @abolishnugreeklife Instagram page, which
        posts anonymous students’ experiences within Greek life, large Greek
        life teams are a problem for NUDM.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Teams are a huge part of raising money and creating a community within
        Dance Marathon,” the member says. “It can create peer pressure because
        the teams are so dependent on Greek life... that participating in Dance
        Marathon without being in Greek life can feel a little isolating, or the
        social pressures to participate along with Greek life are greater.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The @abolishnugreeklife member is glad to see that NUDM is making an
        effort to break up these teams. Despite the difficulties of abolishing
        Greek life entirely, they are hopeful that NUDM’s changes can help
        deconstruct the myth that having a social life is dependent on joining
        Greek life.
      </p>
      <p>
        “One big solution and something that’s actually attainable is separating
        the dependency of social life from Greek life,” the member says. “A lot
        of Northwestern’s campus is run as if Greek life is the only place to
        find community, and I think Dance Marathon has been an example of
        that... To step away from [NUDM] being so interconnected with Greek
        life, they’re opening areas of community and other ways to socialize
        that aren’t tied to Greek life, and I think that’s something that’s
        really great.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The member is optimistic about NUDM’s ability to detach itself from
        Greek life given its smaller community scale, as opposed to the national
        structure of PHA and IFC Greek life that makes reform difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        “In that kind of structure, you see a lack of agency and power on
        individual members’ parts, [which] is one of the main reasons why we
        truly believe reform isn’t possible,” the member says. “That being said,
        other organizations function very differently. Dance Marathon is run by
        students at Northwestern specifically, so... there’s a lot more power to
        make changes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Goswamy makes a similar distinction between NUDM and Greek life,
        explaining that while the two organizations share some members, they
        remain separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        “At our core, we are an organization committed to philanthropic
        fundraising, service and spreading awareness to the Northwestern
        community,” Goswamy says. “This can exist outside of Greek life, and our
        organization is actively working to make it so.”

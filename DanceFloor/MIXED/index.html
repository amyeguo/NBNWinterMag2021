      <p>
        When Weinberg first-year Katrina Kuntz attended the Multiracial Student
        Affinity Space event held by Multicultural Student Affairs (MSA) during
        Wildcat Welcome, she was disappointed to learn that the Mixed Race
        Student Coalition — an affinity club for individuals who identify with a
        mixed race or cultural background — no longer existed. So, when MSA
        officials asked if anyone was interested in restarting the group, Kuntz,
        along with several other first-years, jumped at the chance to create a
        space for multiracial students on Northwestern University’s campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mixed Race Student Coalition was started in 2013 by then-second-
        years Kalina Silverman and Tori Marquez but eventually disbanded in
        2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first-years interested in restarting the club, the process was
        difficult. Usually, former executive board members help to train new
        officers, but there were no existing executive board members to
        transition the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We essentially had to restart the club while also picking up the pieces
        of the old club,” says Elizabeth O’Brien, a Weinberg first-year and the
        current treasurer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the new executive board tried to reach out to the administrators of
        the old Mixed Race Student Coalition Facebook page, they received no
        reply. It took months for the new officers to set up the club, and
        without the social media logins from the previous group, they couldn’t
        take advantage of the club’s preexisting social media following to
        spread the word about the revived organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The board built off of the existing Wildcat Connection page and the
        money left from the old club’s Student Organization Finance Office
        account. They also gave the organization a new name (Multiracial
        Identity Xperience Education and Dialogue, or MIXED), created a new
        Instagram account, developed the club’s organizational structure and
        began recruiting members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mixed race community at Northwestern is large and continually
        growing: According to the 2010-11 Northwestern Common Data Set, only 167
        undergraduates, or about 2% of students, self-identified as mixed (The
        University’s metrics excluded all students who identified as Hispanic or
        Latino). Years later, the 2019-20 Northwestern Common Data Set reported
        that the percentage had grown to about 6.3%, and Northwestern Admissions
        reported that over 17% of the Class of 2024 reported being multiracial.
      </p>
      <p>
        This academic year, the executive board of MIXED, which is all
        first-years, has struggled to reach out to and virtually recruit
        interested students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, Kuntz says that MIXED has succeeded so far in
        creating a community where members can talk about their experiences.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          “I don’t think my identity has ever really felt this valid before.”
        </p>
        <p class="person">Katrina Kuntz, Weinberg first-year</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        “I realized that there’s a lot of ... internal struggles and that kind
        of thing that I’ve never verbalized but I realize are pretty common in
        the multiracial community,” Kuntz says. “I don’t think my identity has
        ever really felt this valid before.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Medill first-year Alex Perry, MIXED’s membership chair, says that
        although she thinks a few of the executive board members are part of
        monoracial groups on campus, MIXED is a place where they can explore all
        sides of their racial identity instead of having to choose just one.
      </p>
      <p>
        For O’Brien, her mixed identity is more important than any one of the
        racial or ethnic identities she holds. She says that MIXED is the one
        identity-based group where she feels she belongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I felt that being mixed meant that I couldn’t join a Black student
        union or anything of the many backgrounds that I’m composed of,” O’Brien
        says. “[MIXED] seemed like a really great opportunity to be a part of
        something where people who identify with many different ethnic
        backgrounds and racial identities could come together.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For Waverly Long, a Bienen and Medill first-year who serves as Events
        and Outreach co-chair, MIXED is not only a place to gather with other
        mixed race individuals and learn about their backgrounds but also a
        place to have meaningful conversations about how media and current
        events apply to multiracial communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of MIXED’s advisors, C.A. Davis, who works for the Northwestern
        Media and Design Studio and hosts a podcast about mixed race issues,
        hopes that these discussions will both help students bond and act as a
        launching pad for talking about more complex issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s always a danger of being in an echo chamber and not really
        diving deeper into these larger issues, histories, topics,” Davis says.
        “Being more critical about these discussions I think is what’s important
        ... so I think time will tell to see how people develop the group.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Kuntz and O’Brien say that in order to avoid creating an echo chamber,
        the executive board of MIXED is focused on engaging with these
        conversations on a larger scale and including all members of the
        Northwestern community. “Sometimes it can feel like all we’re doing is
        sitting in a room and talking about our experiences, but what’s that
        going to solve?” Perry says. “We do want to open up to sharing our
        experiences with monoracial people.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The group is hoping to bring topics related to multiracial identity to
        center stage through guest speakers and events related to different
        members’ cultures. Their dream is that the club will serve dual purposes
        on campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        “One of our goals is educating people on the experience of being mixed
        race,” Long says. “We really enjoy having dialogues about things that
        matter to us and things that are important.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Another goal of the group is to create an inclusive community for all
        Northwestern students: “Whether or not you’re mixed race, you’re
        absolutely welcome to join the club,” Long says. “We would love to have
        you.”

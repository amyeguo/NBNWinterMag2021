        As Communication fourth-year Isabella Min reflected on her time as an
        Asian American Studies minor, she realized that very few of the
        professors she’d had were still at Northwestern University. She can
        think of at least three or four that no longer teach at the University.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s so unfortunate that we don’t have the resources to hire teachers
        for longer terms or provide the benefits that professors need to be able
        to want to stay,” Min says.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of hiring power, according to Min, stems from the Asian
        American Studies’ status as a program, not a department. The program was
        only established as a minor in 1999 after years of student pressure,
        including a 23-day hunger strike in 1995. Asian American Studies became
        available as a major in 2016. Despite further student and faculty
        activism, it has yet to be departmentalized and lacks the funding that
        would come with such status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Northwestern’s ethnic studies programs, which include both the Asian
        American Studies Program and the Latina and Latino Studies Program
        (founded in 2008), have faced a lack of institutional support since
        their inception. The Native American and Indigenous Studies minor,
        approved during the 2018-19 academic year, doesn’t even have its own
        standalone program and is instead housed in the Center for Native
        American and Indigenous Research. Amidst the nationwide push for racial
        justice, Northwestern students and faculty, along with others across the
        country, find departmentalizing ethnic studies programs crucial to
        building equity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication third-year Camille Garcia-Mendoza describes her class on
        Latinx history, taught by professor and Director of the Latina and
        Latino Studies Program Geraldo Cadava, as “eye-opening” in terms of
        learning about the experiences and histories of Latinx populations in
        the United States. She says it helped her gain perspective on her own
        upbringing and family history as a second-generation Cuban American from
        Miami, Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I didn’t learn until this class that there was a very particular
        demographic of Cubans who left in the ’60s versus the ’80s,” she says.
        “It gave me a lot of perspective on what my grandparents’ lives were
        like in Cuba, that they were able to afford to come in the ’60s, which
        is relatively early on.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Garcia-Mendoza found her identity being represented in the class
        refreshing, since she didn’t feel it was in other classes. She hopes
        that increased funding for ethnic studies programs will allow other
        students to get similar opportunities to study their own backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I hope in the future that they get better funding, so they can really
        retain students and be able to do the great work that they’re doing,”
        Garcia-Mendoza says. “I think that they need to be expanded for sure.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2018, the Latinx Asian American Collective, the collaborative
        effort of the student groups Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlan de
        Northwestern and the Asian Pacific American Coalition, began a push for
        the departmentalization of the Latina and Latino Studies and Asian
        American Studies programs. Their proposal and petition quickly gathered
        support, including the signatures of more than 1,000 students and
        faculty and the endorsement of Northwestern University Graduate Workers,
        but their meetings with Northwestern administration resulted in little
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group held a teach-in in May 2018, and in May 2019, Weinberg Dean
        Adrian Randolph approved the hiring of tenure-eligible professors
        specific to an ethnic studies program; previously, only departments had
        this ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Northwestern students aren’t the only ones making the push for
        departmentalization. Students and faculty at the University of Chicago
        have been fighting to departmentalize their Comparative Race and Ethnic
        Studies program under the #EthnicStudiesNow campaign. Harvard University
        students involved with the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition have also
        mobilized in support of establishing an ethnic studies department.
        However, like at Northwestern, both campaigns have seen slow progress
        from their administrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Northwestern’s ethnic studies classes are open to all students, and
        Bienen and Medill third-year Nadine Manske feels that having students
        from various identities benefited classroom discussion in professor
        Patricia Nguyen’s “Contemporary Issues in Asian American Communities:
        Refugee Aesthetics” class, which she took her first year.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There was just such a diverse background of people that made our
        discussions and our understanding of the topic so much broader,” Manske
        says. “[We] really covered a lot more than if it was a class of people
        who all had the same entry level of understanding about the topic.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, Garcia-Mendoza feels that there is a “tough line to walk” between
        genuine curiosity from students who don’t identify with the group in
        question and taking away class spaces from those who do.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Priority should be given to try and get people who identify with those
        identities into these classes so that they can have that experience
        before they graduate,” Garcia-Mendoza says. “But, I certainly think that
        there’s a lot of utility to having people who don’t identify with those
        ethnicities and races take those classes to learn that perspective.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue of who should enroll in ethnic studies classes is complicated
        by the limited number of classes. For the upcoming Spring Quarter, five
        classes are offered in African American or Latina and Latino Studies,
        while there are six classes and a first-year seminar for Asian American
        Studies. To have more classes, ethnic studies programs would need more
        professors, but, as Min noted, that’s difficult without department
        status. The Asian American Studies Program, for example, has only seven
        faculty members, two of whom are visiting associate professors.
      </p>
      <p>
        While departmentalization is helpful, it still doesn’t guarantee equal
        standing with other departments. Northwestern’s Department of African
        American Studies was first established in 1972 following a series of
        student protests, including a 1968 sit-in at Northwestern’s Bursar ’s
        office. In contrast with the Asian American Studies Program, it enjoys
        full departmental status and is composed of 13 faculty members with no
        visiting professors. Still, it pales in comparison to Northwestern’s
        Department of Economics, one of the University’s most popular majors,
        which has 47 faculty members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even beyond nationwide departmentalization and the growth of existing
        ethnic studies departments, Min hopes that ethnic studies courses could
        one day become a Northwestern distribution requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ethnic studies classes all around are so worldly in a sense that it
        touches upon everything from history to the present, to things that are
        going on, breaking down the structures that are in place that hold up
        why things are the way they are,” Min says. “They’ve cultivated the
        person I’ve become today and how I perceive the world.”

        From fairy lights to plastic ivy to pictures from home, dorms at
        Northwestern University have their fair share of decorative staples. But
        some students have moved beyond the ordinary collection of items by
        buying (or making) unique conversation pieces to display. From an
        in-dorm cinema fort to a poster of Kim Jong-un, these are the stories
        behind seven Northwestern first-years’ unconventional dorm decorations.

            Stretching across the wall of Weinberg first-year Ben Lankfer’s 560
            Lincoln St. dorm room is an eye-catching rainbow collage. The
            collage is composed of 125 handpicked album covers from a vari- ety
            of artists, and each image is paired with the Spotify scan code of a
            corresponding song.
            <br /><br />
            After seeing other Spotify code projects on TikTok, Lankfer says he
            was inspired to create a display using his own favorite songs. Pop
            artists dominate the wall, with Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift as
            standouts.
            <br /><br />
            Lankfer says the poster is a particularly personal decoration.
            <br /><br />
            “It’s not just a bunch of album art,” Lankfer says. “It’s something
            special to me and not something that everyone has.”

            What do you get when you combine an empty dorm bed with extra
            sheets? An in-dorm cinema fort, according to Communication
            first-year Nozizwe Msipa.
            <br /><br />
            Msipa, who lives in an Allison Hall double-turned-single,
            transformed her room’s unused bed into any child’s dream fort,
            complete with fairy lights and an Adventure Time Lumpy Space
            Princess plush.
            <br /><br />
            “I had two beds and lots of sheets, and I was just struck by
            inspiration,” Msipa says. “There was nothing telling me no.”
            <br /><br />
            Since she uses the fort on most days to watch movies, Msipa says she
            plans to keep the fort up for the rest of the quarter and will
            continue to order more pillows and lights to beautify her personal
            hideaway.

            Strolling past the front of South Mid-Quads at night, you might spot
            a smiling face peeking through the window: the face of North Korean
            dictator Kim Jong-un. Kim stands in front of an ocean, beside curvy
            lettering that reads “Live, Laugh, Love.”
            <br /><br />
            This curious image is featured on a flag owned by Medill first-year
            Hank Yang, who received it as a birthday gift in January. Yang says
            his side of the room used to be pretty bare, but now the decorative
            flag takes up plenty of wall space.
            <br /><br />
            Yang’s roommate, Weinberg first-year George Graham, has adjusted to
            the flag.
            <br /><br />
            “Every morning I wake up and see Kim Jong-un’s wonderful smile,”
            Graham says.

            A Sacred Heart of Jesus Candle? Nope. In place of Jesus’ head is the

            <br /><br />
            For Medill first-year Catherine Duncan, what started as an inside
            joke between her and a hometown friend about their mutual love of
            Chalamet turned into a personal going-away gift that now sits in her
            Allison dorm.
            <br /><br />
            “I was surprised that she found it,” Duncan says, “but I wasn’t
            surprised that something like this was out there.”
            <br /><br />
            The candle serves as a funny yet meaningful reminder of their
            friendship. After all, what’s better than having Timothée Chalamet
            within arm’s reach?

            Shoehorn on one side, golf club on the other. For Weinberg
            first-year Savir Maskara, it’s the perfect practical dorm
            decoration.
            <br /><br />
            Before leaving for college, Maskara and his friends organized a
            “Goodwill Secret Santa,” with each person buying a $5 gift from the
            store. Maskara received a shoehorn golf club.
            <br /><br />
            While he admits the golf club head doesn’t serve a purpose in the
            dorm room, Maskara uses the shoehorn to put his boots on.
            <br /><br />
            “I have a lot of boots and I’m not very used to putting them on,” he
            says. “It’s easier to just use a shoehorn than to yank it up my
            leg.”
            <br /><br />
            Maskara conveniently hangs his shoehorn golf club on a hook close to
            his closet, so it often sparks inquiries from guests.

            first-year Emily Lester’s dorm room.
            <br />
            After her roommate, McCormick first-year Hannah Rabenhorst, found
            the condoms in her drawer, the two blew them into balloons, danced
            around with them and put a face on one, naming it Calvin.
            <br />
            Lester originally displayed Calvin in her room, but after realizing
            he was in her Zoom back- ground, she relocated him out of frame.
            <br />
            Always sporting a smile, Calvin has a clear view of the Weber Arch
            from his window abode, Lester says.

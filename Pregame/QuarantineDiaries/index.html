      <p>
        <em>I</em>f there is one thing that brings students on campus together
        while simultaneously ripping them apart, it’s Quarantine/Isolation (Q/I)
        Housing. Students who are contact-traced receive an email that starts
        off with the above paragraph, and a follow-up email includes information
        on quarantine rules, packing and mental health assistance. They stay in
        quarantine housing until they receive a negative test on the seventh
        day. Those who test positive for COVID-19 end up in isolation housing
        and go through a similar process until their 10-day quarantine is
        complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a collection of stories from students who found themselves in
        Q/I, either after contracting COVID-19 themselves or after being
        contact-traced. Some used the quiet time to get ahead on schoolwork,
        while others found the monotony and loneliness of Q/I almost too much to
        bear.
      </p>
      <h2>Aidan O’Neil</h2>
      <p>
        McCormick first-year Aidan O’Neil compares Q/I housing to a Scandinavian
        prison, “ you've just moved in, you don't have much, so it feels like an
        empty, bleak room…. It just feels less homey, and you're also stuck in
        there by yourself, isolated,” he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        O’Neil was contact-traced right after the campus-wide Wildcat Wellness
        period, after eating in a common room in late January with someone who
        tested positive. He was moved to Foster-Walker, which houses
        contact-traced students.
      </p>
      <img src="qi_housing.png" />
      <p>
        “When you first get there, they give you a coloring book, a Rubik's cube
        and other things that a 10-year-old would preoccupy themselves with,”
        O’Neil says. “But what I brought that was particularly helpful was my
        small Keurig because I could make coffee that way.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it was frustrating to see everyone socialize after the first
        two weeks of being on campus, O’Neil says he was grateful he had friends
        who were also in Q/I during his stay, with whom he would Zoom for an
        hour every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        O’Neil took advantage of the near-empty hall by blasting music on his
        speaker to pass the time. He recommends bringing room decor to Q/I to
        make it feel a bit more like home, or at least like an actual dorm room.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being isolated and inside for so long, O’Neil says he has
        definitely learned to appreciate even the smallest things in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I remember walking out of my room on day six to get my COVID test, and
        being hit by the wave of fresh air was really nice,” O’Neil says.
      </p>
      <h2>Madison Bruno</h2>
      <p>
        Medill first-year Madison Bruno was contact-traced after her roommate
        tested positive for COVID-19. She was able to participate in group Zoom
        calls with friends who were also in quarantine, and that shared
        experience has led to friendship outside of Foster-Walker’s walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I'm pretty close with all the people who got contact-traced with me,”
        Bruno says. “It’s like a club that no one wants to be a part of.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruno says the lack of in-person interaction and fresh air took a
        significant toll on her mental state. She hardly saw anyone during her
        entire quarantine period, and was only allowed outside to get
        COVID-tested at Searle on the seventh day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was able to keep her emotions in check most of the time,
        mealtimes were where she hit her breaking point. Bruno says she wasn’t
        able to eat a meal without crying, even though the quality wasn’t much
        different from what it had been during Wildcat Wellness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This only happened once, but the chicken was raw, and that really just
        was not it,” Bruno says. “I was not in a good place, and when I cut open
        the chicken and it was pink, I hung up on my mom and cried.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruno recommends keeping busy while in quarantine through any means
        necessary, and to ask for what you need. She found that it was difficult
        at times to get consistent, accurate information about things like
        release times and quarantine rules, so self-advocacy was something she
        had to use while in Q/I.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Just grin and bear it,” Bruno says. “Try to Zoom people while you're in
        there. Get ahead on work so you can hang out with people when you get
        out. Be a little bit assertive when asking for stuff because they'll
        bring you pretty much anything.”
      </p>
      <p>Everything, that is, except for fitted sheets.</p>
      <p>
        “I asked for [one] and they said they could give me tape,” Bruno says.
      </p>

      <h2>Alia Marshall</h2>
      <p>
        Weinberg second-year and field hockey team member Alia Marshall entered
        the Foster-Walker isolation on Jan. 6, only three days after arriving in
        Evanston. She thinks she contracted COVID-19 after flying into Midway on
        a packed plane or possibly from someone back home. Although she wouldn’t
        call isolation a pleasant experience, Marshall was able to get through
        her time in Foster-Walker without too much suffering.
      </p>
      <img src="fosterwalkerhallway.png" />
      <p>
        “It was a little bit lonely not being able to see anybody or go outside.
        But every morning [a Q/I staff member] calls you, and they just ask you
        how you're doing, if you need anything,” Marshall says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marshall says she appreciated how attentive the Q/I staff was. One
        positive interaction happened when Marshall forgot to fill out the meal
        form that must be submitted by 8 p.m. every night. She missed lunch, but
        a Q/I employee called her at dinner time and got her order while picking
        up food at the dining hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marshall’s biggest support during her quarantine was her mom, who
        Marshall says called her every day. Additionally, Marshall brought lots
        of snacks that made her Q/I housing feel less foreign. Each room comes
        with a mini-fridge, and each floor has a microwave, so Marshall
        recommends bringing plenty of comfort food.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Don’t underestimate how much you’re going to eat,” Marshall says. “It
        was five days in and I was like, ‘I don't have any more food.’”
      </p>
      <h2>Peyton Halsey</h2>
      <p>
        “When I first got there, it was really scary,” Weinberg second-year and
        field hockey team member Peyton Halsey says. “They just sent you up in
        the elevator, and you walked in this [hallway] that was really empty,
        all the doors were open. And then you get your room which is super
        small.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Halsey tested positive for COVID-19 after her roommate, Marshall,
        started showing symptoms. She had already started quarantining in her
        off-campus apartment after Marshall tested positive, and moved to
        Foster-Walker for seven days to protect her third roommate, who never
        ended up contracting the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Halsey was in isolation housing in Foster-Walker, and everyone there
        already had COVID-19, she was allowed to socialize with others in common
        rooms socially-distanced with masks on. This meant she could see her
        roommate regularly, which Halsey says helped her feel less alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Honestly after the first day, it was fine, it wasn't scary,” Halsey
        says. “I thought I was going to freak out but I was fine.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Halsey says she was directed by her trainer not to exercise in order to
        avoid an elevated heart rate and subsequent health issues. Her
        quarantine period took place before the field hockey season started, so
        Halsey missed some pre-season training.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It kind of sucked not being able to train,” Halsey says. “We weren't
        even allowed to exercise at all, other than yoga, but I think maybe it
        was good to just rest my body, if that makes sense.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Halsey recommends finding an activity that will make you leave your
        phone and bed every day, even if only for an hour. For her, that
        activity was yoga. She was able to obtain a yoga mat when she arrived at
        Q/I.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Once you have [a yoga mat] and it's sitting on your floor every day,
        it'll make you want to get up and do something even if it's just a light
        workout or mindfulness,” Halsey says. “I think that's something
        important to keep in mind so you're not just staring at your screen for
        literally the whole time.”
      </p>
      <h2>Lena Sauter</h2>
      <p>
        Weinberg second-year Lena Sauter found her way to Foster-Walker after
        her suitemate tested positive the first week she arrived on campus.
        Sauter wasn’t positive for COVID-19 but says she still experienced a
        drop in motivation while in quarantine.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I could feel for sure my productivity just drop off,” Sauter says. “It
        took me like four hours to do a one-hour reading.”
      </p>
      <img src="lenadorm.png" />
      <p>
        Sauter recommends bringing a desk lamp to make up for the lack of
        natural light in the Foster-Walker rooms. She hopes she won’t have to
        take her own advice: because she was only contact-traced, there is the
        potential that she could go back at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sauter didn’t find the experience enjoyable, but says she appreciated
        the peace-of-mind brought by separating herself from others and
        preventing potential outbreaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Knowing that there was no chance, if I had been exposed, of exposing
        anyone else obviously made me feel better,” Sauter says. “I don't really
        care if I get it, I just don't want to give it to anyone else.”
      </p>
      <h2>Sarah</h2>
      <p>
        McCormick first-year Sarah*, whose name has been changed for anonymity,
        was contact-traced on Feb. 4 after eating dinner with someone who
        contracted COVID-19. Loneliness hit Sarah especially hard; she only
        lasted three days in Foster-Walker before her mom drove to Evanston and
        took her home to finish the rest of her quarantine.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It's more depressing than you could ever imagine,” Sarah says. “It's
        literally like a plastic bed with two sheets and this plastic blanket.
        The windows don't open, it’s depressing fluorescent light. It really got
        to me. I really don't even want to be dramatic about it, but it made me
        so sad.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of human interaction, Sarah says, was the worst part of
        quarantine. As she was in quarantine housing, there was still a chance
        of COVID-19 spreading between residents, which meant that Sarah was
        unable to socialize in common areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don't think I've ever gone 40 hours without talking to another person
        in my entire life,” Sarah says. “I think that freaked me out. You can
        FaceTime people, but it’s not the same.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Now back on campus, Sarah is taking more precautions to make sure she
        doesn’t end up in Foster-Walker again.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I will definitely do whatever I can to not go back to quarantine,”
        Sarah says.
